# Zuni Youth Enrichment Project Interactive Map
An interactive map created using Leaflet.js for the Zuni Youth Enrichment Project (ZYEP) in Zuni Pueblo, NM. Thank you to Professor Joseph Holler for including me as a developer on this project, and for the guidance and support as I began to wrap my head around Leaflet.

This work came out of an indepedent, self-designed course I created for my last semester as an undergraduate at Middlebury College. Head over to my blog at http://parkerziegler.com/senior-research-programming-for-gis/ to get a more in depth description of my design process for this map and to see some of my other work.

This map makes use of the Leaflet Maki Markers plug-in developed by jseppi to bring Mapbox Maki Markers into a Leaflet map. It also adjusts the symbology dynamically with the choice of base map â€“ notice that a thin red line will appear beneath the trails when the USGS base map is selected, and then subsequently disappears when you switch to the Mapbox satellite base map. This is to help improve the visual hierarchy of the map.

To get a look at the final version of the map (which Joe worked to tinker with a bit more), head over to http://www.josephholler.com/zunimap/zunimap.html.
